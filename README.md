# Factorio-Biter-Extermination
Research and launch a biter killing weapon to cleanse the planet


Designed for players who enjoy the biters for the early game stages, but later on they find them an annoyance. This mod adds a natural ingame way to simplify your life. Research the weapon, produce 1 and launch it in to space, job done.


Details
------------

On launch the weapon will kill everything on the "enemy" team on the planet that the weapon is launched from.
Only supports/uses base game technologies and items.
Can be used with other mods that want to give the item and set the technology cost to 0 so it can't be researched manually ever.


Configurable Features
--------------

- Configurable cost of technology by setting how many units each requires:
    - Each technology unit is: 4 military, 2 space and chemical, 1 of each other science pack.
    - If the technology units are set to 0 then no technology will be available to unlock the recipe.
- Configurable cost of recipe by setting how many units each requires:
    - Each recipe unit is: 1 atomic bomb, 25 poison capsules, 10 steel.
- Option to have pollution disabled and removed from the entire game upon weapon deployment to save UPS.
