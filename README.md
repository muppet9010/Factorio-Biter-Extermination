# Factorio-Biter-Extermination
Research and launch a biter killing weapon to cleanse the planet



Designed for players who enjoy the biters for the early game stages, but later on they find them an annoyance. This mod adds a natural ingame way to simplify your life. Research the weapon, produce 1 and launch it in to space, job done.

Configurable cost of technology and recipe by setting how many units each requires:
- Each technology unit is: 4 military, 2 space and chemical, 1 of each other science pack.
- Each recipe unit is: 1 atomic bomb, 25 poison capsules, 10 steel.

On launch the weapon will kill everything on the "enemy" team on the planet that the weapon is launched from. Option to have pollution disabled and removed from the entire game upon weapon deployment to save UPS.
Only supports/uses base game technologies and items.
